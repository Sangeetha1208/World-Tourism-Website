WORLD TOURISM WEBSITE

The **World Tourism Website** is a front-end web development project created using HTML and CSS. It is designed to serve as a basic travel and tourism website that provides users with helpful information about various tourist destinations, services, and ways to get in touch. The website consists of multiple static web pages that are visually organized, easy to navigate, and informative for users who are interested in travel planning or exploring tourism options.

The homepage (`home.html`) acts as the entry point of the website. It welcomes users and gives them a brief overview of the purpose of the site. It is designed to capture the attention of visitors and guide them to other important sections of the site. The “About Us” page (`aboutus.html`) contains information about the tourism service provider, including their mission, values, and commitment to offering a great travel experience. This helps build trust with potential travelers.

Users can navigate to the “Contact” page (`contact.html`) if they wish to reach out with questions, inquiries, or travel assistance needs. The contact form allows users to input their details and message, providing a simple way to connect with the organization. Similarly, the “Feedback” page (`feedback.html`) allows visitors to share their experience or thoughts about the website or services. Collecting feedback is essential for continuous improvement and understanding user needs.

The “Services” page (`service.html`) outlines the different types of travel-related services that the organization offers, such as travel planning, tour packages, accommodations, and customer support. This helps users understand what kind of help they can expect from the agency. The “Tour” page (`tour.html`) provides a list or gallery of available travel destinations, including brief descriptions. This is a key part of the website, as it encourages users to explore and get inspired for their next trip.

To keep users engaged and updated, there is also a “Subscribe” page (`subscribe.html`) where users can sign up for newsletters, deals, or updates related to new tours or services. Once a user completes a form successfully, they are directed to a “Successful” page (`successful.html`) that confirms their action.

Styling across all pages is handled using a single CSS file (`style.css`). The website uses clean design principles with basic color schemes and layouts. It is beginner-friendly and serves as a great learning project for students or developers who want to practice web design and understand the structure of a multipage website.

Currently, this project is still in development. New features are being planned, including improved layout, interactivity using JavaScript, and possibly backend integration in the future. The goal is to eventually turn this static website into a more dynamic platform that can serve real travel customers.

In summary, the World Tourism Website is a simple but effective static website project that covers essential pages required for a tourism service. It demonstrates the power of HTML and CSS in creating useful and visually appealing web experiences. This project can be used as a foundation for further development or as a learning tool for aspiring web developers.
